# MRI Tumor Classification using VGG-16

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to classify MRI scans to determine if the subject has a tumor or not, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-16 architecture.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metric  
The performance of the model is evaluated using **Accuracy**, defined as:  

Accuracy = (Number of correctly predicted images / Total number of tested images) × 100%


---

## 💡 Final Results  

| **Dataset**       | **Accuracy** |  
|--------------------|--------------|  
| **Validation Set** | ~88%         |  
| **Test Set**       | ~80%         |
